I chose a permisive license so that this code can be used, modified, published, and distributed as the users wish. I do not need pantent protection, or trademark protection, and I am not responsible for if this
software breaks or is defective. The freedom is for the user to use and modify this software as they want. As this philosophy of OpenDAW is for all users and developers to own this software. This project is in contrast
to the closed source digital audio workstations that have been prevalent in the market. This software is extensible and should be open for everyone.
